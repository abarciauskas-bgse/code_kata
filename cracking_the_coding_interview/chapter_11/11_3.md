Given an input file with four billion integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory.

Are they distinct? Are there bounds on the values they can take?

An int in mysql has up to 4 billion values (2 bill pos / neg or 4 bill pos) so if we are guaranteed it is in this range then the total memory space requirement is:

* 4 bytes per int * 4 billion ints = 16 billion bytes = 16,000,000,000 bytes = 16,000,000 kb = 16,000 mb = 16 GB (we learned that 1 gb is equal to 1billion bytes)
* so a naive implementation could chunk the file into 16 parts and iterate through each part, conducting a linear search for the integer. (If it is found we may have early termination)
* a better implementation would distribute this across at least 16 machines with 1GB of memory

An even better implementation:

1 GB of memory can store 8 billion bits, so we can map each integer from
