# Tips

## 5 Algorithm Approaches

1. **Examplify:** Work through an example and generalize
2. **Pattern Matching:** Identify similar problems and their solutions, evaluate if any of them may be helpful.
3. **Simplify and Generalize:** Simplify a constraint of the problem, solve it and then try to generalize
4. **Base Case and Build:** Solve the problem for a base case (e.g. just one element), then 2 and on.
