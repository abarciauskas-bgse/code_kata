# Code Katas

This repository is dedicated to code katas and other programming heuristics.

I initiated it in anticipation of interviewing for engineering positions.

Resources used:

* **[Cracking the Coding Inteview](www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf)**
* **[Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](http://cin.ufpe.br/~grm/downloads/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_in_Java.pdf)**
* **[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Stanford via Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)**
* **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)**

(Others yet used):

* [Career Cup Google Interview Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=google-interview-questions)
* [Shared Interview questions on statistics for data science](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vih3gvj8cgfm1cq/IQ.docx?dl=0)


## Clarifying Questions for Algorithms:

1. Is the data sorted?
2. How is the data provided sorted?
2. What data type is it? Primitive data type? Restrictions on data type?

## Process

* I read a chapter of DSAA a day and 2 of Cracking the Coding Interview (the latter has page-length chapters)
* I solved ~2 challenges a day, at least in pseudo code. These were from CTCI and hackerrank
* I tried to think application when reading these resources, how it applies to current problems I'm working on. For example, finding a minimum cut for Algorithms can be applied to the clustering of documents where shared edges between documents are shared words
