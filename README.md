# Code Katas

This repository is dedicated to code katas and other programming heuristics.

I initiated it in anticipation of interviewing for engineering positions.

Resources used:

* **[Cracking the Coding Inteview](www.eenadupratibha.net/Engineering-Colleges/Engineering-Jobs/Documents/crackingthecodinginterview.pdf)**
* **[Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](http://cin.ufpe.br/~grm/downloads/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_in_Java.pdf)**
* **[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Stanford via Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)**

## Clarifying Questions for Algorithms:

1. Is the data sorted?
2. How is the data provided sorted?
2. What data type is it? Primitive data type? Restrictions on data type?
