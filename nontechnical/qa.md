# Non-technical Q&A

### 1. Talk about a time you worked on a user-focused product and how you kept those requirements in mind?

When I was designing SensorLink, the mHealth user registration and data ingestion platform, I saw had often been a disconnect between product and engineers. Product managers were the ones directly in contact with customers of a product and responsible for communicating their needs and the priorities of the project. But communication is a 2-way street: it was important to ask them for information, often people don't realize what they do and do not share with necessary parties. Often they are busy as well and unable to attend engineering meetings such as scrums and planning (and often it is inefficient for them to attend these meetings). So I set up weekly meetings between myself, my technical manager and the product manager to review design decisions, what we had done the past week and were planning to do. The objectives of these meetings were to make sure any design decisions I had made in the past week were in line with what the product manager anticipated the product to look like, or gain further perspective on the priorities of the project. It also helped to focus our work: when considering the user interface for SensorLink, it was important we know what the diversity of the user base looked like: though for the most part the users in practice would be on-site clinical researchers, there would also be elder patients and users from many different countries so we knew we had to prioritize user experience, protect the user from errors, and translations. Easy registration meant more signups and less trouble for our call staff.

### 2. How can you tell if something is working?

I am a big believer in testing, in as many forms as is available and throughout the process. As a designer and engineer, we are often too close to our products for too long a time. While at Medidata, I emphasized we write comprehensive unit and functional tests for both back and front-end code. Often it lengthened the process, but as a team we only shunned testing things which were prohibitively difficult to test, and when this happened we wrote manual tests and tagged them for out SQA team members to execute manually. In addition to tests that are hard to write, I emphasize having external human testers for all features. I wrote high-level instructions on what the feature being tested was, and when the app was not completely built out such that setup was required to test new features, I provided detailed written instructions.

I have also conducted user testing. For the app I am currently working on this looked like 3 sessions with users some of which had never heard of a neural network or have familiarity with linear algebra. This was an incredible experience for me. I'm not trying to be pedantic but just being in a technical field you don't realize what is completely non-obvious to others: for example vector algebra, even when represented as x1, x2 and a set of weights. How do we describe this in terms to someone who has never studied algebra or linear algebra?

What is a class and how is it linearly seperable?

These are the type of questions I'm thinking through how to talk about them in non-ml terms

### 3. What are your weaknesses?

Answering this question is either self-harmful or underhandedly self-complementary - but it is still a useful question. I want to say yes to everything. I've gotten better at saying no when I know I don't have time but this has the opposite problem of limiting myself. When I was reflecting about this type of question, I realized one thing I have gained and lost is the overly optimistic I can do it all. I probably can but not well and not within certain time frames. Taking on projects and new tasks is a balancing act of promise and delivery.

Another weakness is that I definitely tends towards autonomy. I am a problem solver and I like taking on everything myself. This has obvious advantages, but one is not taking advantage of the team or asking questions when it is necessary by design, omission or time constraints.

Also I often want to take on projects where I find an opportunity to build something new or cool - the true task lies in what is needed and prioritizing that work. Perfect example in user experience vs enhanced feature set.

### 4. Why did you chose X project?

### 5. What methodologies excite you and why?

In general, new fields of work; for example Bayesian program learning excites me because it is a powerful tool that is somewhat new to machine learning research and text mining because there are so many sources of data to be mined and then many common machine learning techniques which can then be applied. The difficulty becomes looking for the right question.

### 6. What does it mean to work as a team member?

Taking on different roles. I did this at Medidata in all senses: communicating product requirements, leading meetings normally led by project managers, breaking down all the tasks in the SensorLink Project into stories with descriptions so we could estimate a time line for a variety of features sets, taking into consideration some feature sets depend on others, emphasizing we should all act as SQA, especially when we were at risk of missing a deadline, this could make a huge difference as to whether we met the deadline or not because often SQA were the bottleneck when on many different projects and/or during validation.
